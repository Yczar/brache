# Getting Started with Brache

Setting up a new Brache project is straightforward. In this quick start guide, you'll learn how to create a new Brache project, structure your application, and run it for the first time.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into Brache, ensure you have the following:

- **Dart SDK**: Brache is built on Dart. Make sure you have the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) installed.
- **Brache CLI**: Install the Brache command-line interface tool to streamline the project creation and management process.

To install the Brache CLI, run:

```bash
pub global activate brache_cli
```

## Creating a New Brache Project

With the Brache CLI installed, creating a new project is just one command away:

```bash
brache create my_brache_project
```

This command initializes a new Brache project in the `my_brache_project` directory.

## Navigating Your Brache Project

Once your project is set up, navigate to your project's directory:

```bash
cd my_brache_project
```

Inside, you'll find a predefined project structure. The main application file is `main.dart`. This file serves as the entry point to your Brache application.

## Running Your Brache Application

To run your Brache application, use the following command:

```bash
brache run
```

Your application will start, and you should see a basic Brache window or view, depending on the default template provided by the CLI.

## Next Steps

Congratulations on setting up your first Brache project! Here's what you can do next:

- Explore the project structure and familiarize yourself with the core components.
- Modify `main.dart` to customize your application's starting view.
- Check out [Brache vs. Others](/brache-vs-others) to understand how Brache stands out among other graphics frameworks.

Happy coding with Brache! ðŸš€
